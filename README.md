# DECARBONATE
This is a web app made to calculate a users carbon ðŸ‘£ and help them regulate their carbon emissions.

We have a page for simple emission calculator, With daily and monthly categories.
Daily once a for frequent activities monthly


Signup and login page

On the profile page we can view the report of the data that was submitted on admission calculator page

Under speech we have added the functionality where we can upload a picture and the picture would be classified into the 16 most common waste item in our database and it's every value of carbon footprint will be shown this was achieved by building a convolutional neural network using tensorflow muse transfer learning and image augmentation technique to make a lakh of data and the carbon emission of the object in the picture uploaded will be added to daily emissions on profile-page.

We have also added a chatting platform on this website for people to discuss tips and ideas over how to reduce carbon emissions with the feature of upvote on each post.


## Link for ppt and video

This is the link for the drive containing ppt and project video[DECARBONATE DRIVE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-uqXM4gkZabDD35C7Fr3Ggbjw0BvKwPZ?usp=sharing)  

# Procedure to start the functioning model
Make sure that you have numpy, tensorflow, npm installed. 
Press npm i to install all the reauired modules.   
Then run *nodemon* on one terminal and *npm start* on other.  
The web page would open and you can experience the features

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
