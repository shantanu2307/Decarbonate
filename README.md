# DECARBONATE
This is a web app made for users to calculate their carbon-footprint👣 and help them regulate their carbon emissions.

We have a page for simple emission calculator with a daily and monthly category, where daily is for frequent 
activities and monthly is to record non-frequent activities.

On the profile page we can view the report of the data that was submitted on emissions calculator page.

We have also added the functionality where we can upload a picture and the picture would be classified into the 16 most 
common waste item in our database and it's every value of carbon footprint will be shown this was achieved by building a 
convolutional neural network using tensorflow muse transfer learning and image augmentation technique to make a lakh of 
data and the carbon emission of the object in the picture uploaded will be added to daily emissions on profile-page.

We have also added a chatting platform on this website for people to discuss tips and ideas over how to reduce
carbon emissions with the feature of upvote 👍 on each post.

# Procedure to start the functioning model
Make sure that you have numpy, tensorflow, npm installed. 
Press npm i to install all the reauired modules.   
Then run *nodemon* on one terminal and *npm start* on other.  
The web page would open and you can experience the features

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
